<H3>Aspiring eLearning Designer</H3>
    
<p>Hi, my name is Amanda, and I’m studying to be an elearning designer. 
    I earned my <em>bachelor’s</em> and <em>master’s degrees</em> in <b>English</b> from California State University, Chico. 
    I am back in school for a second <em>master’s degree</em> in <b>educational technology</b> from California State University, 
    Los Angeles. Also, I am earning a graduate certificate in serious games and simulations from the University of Missouri.
    <br><br>
    I’ve worked at Chico State since 2016. First, I was a brand writer and campus editor. 
    Now, I’m an office manager in the chemistry department. During the 2020–21 COVID-19 lockdown, I saw how chemistry 
    teachers struggled to find online programs to substitute for in-person activities and lessons. Chemistry is not easy 
    to teach online. That experience is why I decided to return to school and study educational technology. 
    I want students and teachers to have easy access to quality elearning and have fun at the same time.</p>
