    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3> 
    <p>I'm an aspiring elearning designer and developer and want to show you my skills, expertise, and experience in designing and developing online 
    learning and training materials. Through my work, I’ll demonstrate my creativity, instructional design prowess, and technical proficiency in utilizing elearning 
    tools and technologies. You’ll see a diverse range of elearning projects and subjects that highlight my ability to create engaging 
    and interactive learning experiences, illustrating my understanding of instructional design principles and best practices. 
    And you’ll see that I have fun doing it. My aim with this portfolio is to communicate my expertise in different subject areas 
    and industries, and how I addressed specific learning needs and challenges through my designs. My portfolio includes highlights 
    in storyboarding, coding, and programming, showing my ability to integrate multimedia elements and interactivity into elearning modules, 
    and demonstrating my knowledge of SCORM or ADDIE standards and practices.</p>
